# CNN-image-classification-wit-Cifar-10

In this exercise we will compare feedforward neural networks with convolutional neural net- works on the cifar10 dataset. You can find the description of the dataset at https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html. 

• Train a feedforward neural network and evaluate its performance on the training and test sets. You can experiment with the number and size of the hidden layers to see what works best.

• Train a convolutional neural network and evaluate its performance on the training and test sets. Remember to include dense layers towards the end. Experiment with different combinations of 2D convolutions, max-pooling and dropout.
